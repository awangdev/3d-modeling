# 3d-modeling
This project is using ThreeJS to build 3D Building Floor Plan models from Floor Blue Print images. This is a early stage prototype, only allowing to pick pre-processed file.

***Example***

This is a random floor plan found online, and with the 3D Modeling tool, we can build a 3D prototype model.

Basically any map (so far I have decide only recognize black color as height) can be prototyped. Another example, I took the campus map of my college and made a model:
